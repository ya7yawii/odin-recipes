        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>Couscous</strong> is a North African 
            dish of small steamed granules of rolled durum
            wheat semolina that is traditionally served with
            a stew spooned on top. Couscous is a staple
            food throughout the Maghrebi cuisines of Algeria,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia">Tunisia</a>, 
            Mauritania, Morocco, and Libya. The word couscous,
            alternately cuscus or kuskus, is of Berber origin,
            it means "well formed, well rolled, rounded".</p>
            <p>In December 2020, Algeria, Mauritania, Morocco
            and Tunisia obtained official recognition for the 
            knowledge, know-how and practices pertaining to the 
            production and consumption of couscous on the Representative
            List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity 
            by UNESCO. The joint submission by the four countries 
            was hailed as an "example of international cooperation."</p>

            <li>4 zucchini , peeled lengthwise, alternately leaving a layer of skin</li>
            <li>6 small potatoes , peeled</li>
            <li>10 oz. chickpeas (canned)</li>
            <li>4 green hot peppers , fried in oil (optional)</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add Â½ cup (120ml) of oil into a large pan. 
            Fry the onion over medium heat for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic, tomato paste and harissa 
            and continue frying for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the caraway, coriander, and chili powder.
            Mix and continue cooking for another 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the lamb meat and mix well so that the 
            pieces are covered with the sauce. Cook for 5 minutes
            stirring regularly.</li>
            <li>Cover with water. Add the turnips and carrots,
            and cook on low/medium heat for 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, prepare the couscous semolina as indicated
            on the package, with boiling water, salt, and oil.</li>
            <li>After 45 minutes, add the zucchini, potatoes and chickpeas.</li>
            <li>Cook for at least another 30 to 40 minutes over 
            low to medium heat. Monitor the cooking of the vegetables.
            If some vegetables are cooked before the meat, remove 
            them from the pan and place them on a serving platter. 
            Proceed in the same way with all the vegetables to prevent 
            them from cooking too much.</li>
            <li>10 minutes before the end of cooking, get a few ladles
            of broth (one at a time) and wet the couscous semolina. 
            Mix the semolina well after each ladle until it gets 
            moistened enough.</li>
            <li>Arrange the semolina in a tajine pot. Decorate the 
            dish with the vegetables and the meat all around. Garnish
            with fried green hot peppers (optional).</li>
        </ol>
