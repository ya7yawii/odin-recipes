        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The Tunisian tagine is not an ordinary egg dish, 
        it is very flavorful with distinct and heady blend 
        of North African spices; just what you need to wake 
        your taste buds up.</p>
        <p>When people hear tagine, the thing that comes to 
        mind is the Moroccan dish cooked in a clay pot with 
        domed lid, but the Tunisian tagine locally known as 
        “<em>tajin sibnekh</em>” is totally different. It is 
        an egg dish baked with potatoes, meat, cheese, vegetables, 
        herbs and North African spices, similar to an Italian 
        frittata or Spanish tortilla.</p>
        <p>It is usually served as a starter in the region, 
        but it can serve as a complete meal, as it is filling 
        and quite nutritious too. The Tunisian frittata is 
        rich protein and carbohydrates as well as vitamins 
        and minerals from the additional vegetables and herbs.</p>
